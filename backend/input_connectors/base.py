# Google Drive: Scan on regular basis (time interval?):
#   1. index the modified chunks of modified files
#   2. delete all te chunks of deleted files
#   3. index all chunks of new files

# Google Calender Data could be  fetched in Real Time (indexing prolly not required?)

# GMail: how much data to be fetched and indexed???
#   - recency? then how recent?
#   - relevance? then metric? [Human in the loop??????]

# Research about HubSpot, Salesforce and other Sales, CRM based connectors.

# !!! Create Base Class for all connectors !!!

# How to manage metadata ????
